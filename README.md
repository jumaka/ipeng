# iPeng

This is a github repository for the iPeng skin for the Logitech Media Server. The aim is to make it more compatible with
modern iDevices and Chrome. This is not to replace the App Store product but to provide a decent skin for Android.

Lots of the basics are now working. Note this is not responsive at this time it is fixed viewport.

Tested on:

* Safari on iPhone 5
* Chrome on Galaxy
* Chrome on Windows
