License

iPeng is written by me, based on the Skins that came with SqueezeCenter. iPeng is published under LGLP 2.1, but it may contain elements that are published under different licenses, most notably any carryover code from SqueezeCenter. Also, it requires SqueezeCenter to be installed, and you need version 7.0a1 (beta) to use iPeng.

LGPL 2.1 is the license under which iPeng is published. It was developed and maintained by the Free Software Foundation and can be obtained there. See also LGPL-2.1.txt.

Why LGPL and not GPL?

iPeng is just a module using other copyrighted material, most notably SqueezeCenter and its components. Some of this material is being published under different licenses than GPL so iPeng cannot be made into a working software under the GPL, especially not GPL 3.


EXCLUSION OF WARRANTY

iPeng is provided as is and comes without any warranty, expressed or implied.


Installation

To install iPeng install SqueezeCenter (from v7 on) first and place the iPeng folder into SqueezeCenter/server/HTML. You can then access iPeng through <SqueezeCenter>:9000/iPeng.
