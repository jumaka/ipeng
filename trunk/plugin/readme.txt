License

iPeng skin is written by Joerg Schwieder, based on the Skins that came with SqueezeCenter. iPeng is published under LGLP 2.1, but it may contain elements that are published under different licenses, most notably any carryover code from SqueezeCenter. Also, it requires SqueezeCenter to be installed, and you need at least version 7.0 to use iPeng.

iPeng plugin is written by Erland Isaksson and published together with iPeng skin under LGPL 2.1

LGPL 2.1 is the license under which iPeng is published. It was developed and maintained by the Free Software Foundation and can be obtained there. See also LGPL-2.1.txt.

Why LGPL and not GPL?

iPeng is just a module using other copyrighted material, most notably SqueezeCenter and its components. Some of this material is being published under different licenses than GPL so iPeng cannot be made into a working software under the GPL, especially not GPL 3.


EXCLUSION OF WARRANTY

iPeng is provided as is and comes without any warranty, expressed or implied.


Installation

To install iPeng install SqueezeCenter (from v7 on) first, place the iPeng folder into SqueezeCenter/server/Plugins and restart SqueezeCenter. You can then access iPeng through <SqueezeCenter>:9000/iPeng. Configuration options are accessible under Settings->Plugins->iPeng.
Note: If you have used previous versions of iPeng that were not distributed as a plugin (that is, they were installed under /server/HTML), you have to delete these versions.
